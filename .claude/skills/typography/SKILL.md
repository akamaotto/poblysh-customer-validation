Typography instantly signals quality. Avoid using boring, generic fonts.

Never use: Inter, Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, default system fonts

Here are some examples of good, impactful choices:
- Code aesthetic: JetBrains Mono, Fira Code, Space Grotesk
- Editorial: Playfair Display, Crimson Pro
- Technical: IBM Plex family, Source Sans 3
- Distinctive: Bricolage Grotesque, Newsreader

Pairing principle: High contrast = interesting. Display + monospace, serif + geometric sans, variable font across weights.

Use extremes: 100/200 weight vs 800/900, not 400 vs 600. Size jumps of 3x+, not 1.5x.

Pick one distinctive font, use it decisively. Load from Google Fonts.
